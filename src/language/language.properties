pane.how.to.use.content=Except for opening the files, all other functions are automatic. Once both files are opened, the program will automatically start the scanning process. When finished, the results will be displayed in a table in a new window.
pane.information-content=Hash Checker is a program for verifying file integrity. To do this, it computes the sum of the hash of the file and compares it with the official summations contained in another file.
pane.language.content=At the time the program runs, it tries to use the same operating system language, if that fails, the default language - English - will be used instead. The language can be changed at any time in the main window. All other windows will be updated when the language is changed.
pane.operation.content.1=After both files are opened, the program analyzes the official file, filtering only the valid hashes. Based on them, the program determines which algorithms should be used to test the file.
pane.operation.content.2=After analysis, the program separates each algorithm into a thread. This increases performance, especially on multi-core processors.
pane.operation.content.3=As soon as the threads are finished, the results are stored. When all threads are finished, the results will be compared to the official data, then sorted and displayed in a table format in a new window.
pane.operation.content.4=When this report window is closed, the program is ready to start a new task.
